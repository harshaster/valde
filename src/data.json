I don't know how to apologise or make up for all that I said and all I do or rather not do. Ordering you things is one of them. So I was long thinking what I should to do miimic it closely. After trying a lot of ideas, this is what i finally resorted with and even then i am very late. Will try to get it to you before 12 hopefully. I want to write quite a lot of things. But I will keep it short for this one and maybe edit later on. For now, just know that I am really very sorry for everything and I do not want to lose you. Yes all the differences and arguments are there but going past, you are perfect. Even the things I get mad about, those are what I am not at par with you, and not a problem with you. You are just what you need to be and I love you for that. I love all things about you. You are out proud and loud and it has taken me so long to even become 1 percent of that. I want to say sorry once again, but what will it do. Let's keep this one short and just know that making efforts for you, loving you, taking your care, buying things for you has always been the most passionate and rewarding things I have done. I love you. I will try to make up to you in some way or the other. ! <br><br> ~Harshit"
